# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day1: started challenge and made Caffeinism-Hub

### About my Challenge

Today I decided to start two new challenges.

First, and finally, I joined 100 Days Of Code community!
I'm so interested in it, but I hesitated. Now I made up my mind to write code everyday in 100 days 💻

Second, I'll try to participate this challenge in English.
I'm a not native English speaker, and I've never tried to communicate in English, or other my non native language.
It means I lost my opportunity to find great friend. Sad😭
So I'll go for it! 🔥

I have my twitter account here → https://twitter.com/caffeinism_tech

I want to become friend with you🥳

### Caffeinism-Hub

I love JavaScript, and HTML, CSS.
And I have made "Caffeinism-Hub" in this two weeks, so I start 100 Day Of Code challenge with this project!

https://github.com/routine-works/caffeinism-hub

I made only frontend and implemented only few features. (README is empty now, I must fill it)

I want to make these features👇

- [ ] user can post image
- [ ] input field is hidden, but if user click "make post" button, field is display
- [ ] responsive design
- [ ] make emoji display more cool
- [ ] make input field larger

## Day2: making Caffeinism-Hub

https://github.com/routine-works/caffeinism-hub

- modify generate random text setting more "caffeinism"
- changed CSS properties order

- [ ] user can post image
- [ ] input field is hidden, but if user click "make post" button, field is display
- [ ] responsive design
- [x] make emoji display more cool
- [ ] make input field larger

A big progress is the Changing of emoji display.
Now there are always shown, expect user don't post any feeling.
User's feeling is described as a big emoji!

## Day3: making Caffeinism-Hub function

Today, my code doesn't work.

I'm trying to make the function that user can post there own image, but I can't finish it.
I think If I spend a little bit time, maybe It can be solve... but I am too sleepy😪 lol

- [ ] user can post image → in progress 💨
- [ ] input field is hidden, but if user click "make post" button, field is display
- [ ] responsive design
- [x] make emoji display more cool
- [ ] make input field larger

## Day4: making modules in Caffeinism-Hub

Today, I could solve yesterday's mystery! Now user's post image function is available😉
I must generate src data, but I was making tag data and set it as src. lol

It is a simple mistake, but I can't find easily.
So I started to fix my spaghetti code🍝

I think I can use import & export notation, and add new file "dataStore. But it throw error:(
I googled it and find it CORS error.

I couldn't fix it. Tomorrow's assignment.

Should I build server?🤔

- [ ] divide files into modules
- [ ] input field is hidden, but if user click "make post" button, field is display
- [ ] make input field larger
- [ ] responsive design
- [x] user can post image
- [x] make emoji display more cool

## Day5: trying node

I have taken rest for 2 days because of mental breakdown🤒 I'm going to restart coding days!

Today, I tried to use node. I could install, but not working because of window object can't use in node environments.
How can I use window.prompt? How can I add event?
I mast search and think about it more and more...

## Day6: playing with GAS

I have wanted flush card application for a long time. But I can't find useful app.
So I decided to make it myself! 

Making Caffeinism-Hub is so much fun, but I temporarily suspend it.

I'm going to use Google spread sheet for it, so also I'm going use GAS.

At work I sometime use GAS and have some skills. I'm excited in improving my skill.
