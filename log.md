# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day1: started challenge and made Caffeinism-Hub

### About my Challenge

Today I decided to start two new challenges.

First, and finally, I joined 100 Days Of Code community!
I'm so interested in it, but I hesitated. Now I made up my mind to write code everyday in 100 days ðŸ’»

Second, I'll try to participate this challenge in English.
I'm a not native English speaker, and I've never tried to communicate in English, or other my non native language.
It means I lost my opportunity to find great friend. SadðŸ˜­
So I'll go for it! ðŸ”¥

I have my twitter account here â†’ https://twitter.com/caffeinism_tech

I want to become friend with youðŸ¥³

### Caffeinism-Hub

I love JavaScript, and HTML, CSS.
And I have made "Caffeinism-Hub" in this two weeks, so I start 100 Day Of Code challenge with this project!

I made only frontend and implemented only few features. (README is empty now, I must fill it)

I want to make these featuresðŸ‘‡

- [] user can post image
- [] input field is hidden, but if user click "make post" button, field is display
- [] responsive design
- [] make emoji display more cool
- [] make input field larger
